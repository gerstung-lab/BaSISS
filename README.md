# Spatial genomics maps the structure, character and evolution of cancer clones 

This repository contains code that was used to analyse Base Specific In Situ Sequencing (BaSISS) data, observe coexisting cancer clones and describe their distinctive immunological and phenotypic properties.

## Notebooks
#### Data preparation
Loading and alignment of BaSISS, ISS and image data.

#### PD9694 main analysis
Subclones localisation and expression characterisation in sample PD9694 which consists of two discrete oestrogen receptor (ER) positive invasive
primary breast cancers with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

#### PD14780 main analysis
Subclones localisation and expression characterisation in sample PD14780 which includes two ER negative
invasive breast cancers and a draining axillary lymph node that contains metastatic cells.

#### Figures
Miscellaneous figures mostly with raw BaSISS and ISS signals

## Dataset
Raw data is avaliable upon request.
